# Meedo
## This repository contains Klipper config files that I have running on my heavily modified Weedo x40 IDEX 3D printer.
   - _IDEX Support has been added!_

## The modifications on my printer that affect the configurations are as follows:
  - Direct drive: Orbiter v2 extruder & filament sensor
    - Utilizes a custom hotend shroud that improves cooling with 2 5015 blower fans. The shroud also allows for the mounting of the extuder and an accelerometer for Klipper input shaping.
  - LEDs and webcam
    - I have a webcam mounted to the gantry with a 3D printer arm so that it goes up while printing. To improve recording and viewing quality, I have added neopixel LEDs to the top of the printer frame and a few on the webcam arm.
##PLEASE look through the files to avoid damage to your machine. At a minimum, offsets with need to be set in the IDEX_macros.cfg.
